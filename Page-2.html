            Protests have been happening all around the world to stop climate change and try to get countries to listen and do something about all the carbon emissions and safeguard the future.
            </p>
            <p><br><br>
            Under the Paris Agreement, signed in 2016, many countries pledged carbon emissions caps that weren’t ambitious enough to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius or below. The Climate Action Tracker follows countries who signed the pact to assess whether they’re on track to meet their self-set goals. The Gambia’s goal is 6 million metric tons of carbon; the U.S.’s is 1.8 trillion tons.
            </p>
            <p><br><br>
            Morocco is one of only two countries with a plan to reduce its CO2 emissions to a level consistent with limiting warming to 1.5 degrees C. Morocco’s National Energy Strategy calls for generating 42 percent of its electricity production from renewables by 2020, and 52 percent by 2030. If other countries can follow suit then this will really help the environment and stop the protests that take out so much of peoples time and money.
