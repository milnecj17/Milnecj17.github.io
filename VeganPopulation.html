             <p> The population of vegans has varied heavily in the pasts years.
                
                
            </p>
            <p>
            Just 6 years ago in 2014 the vegan population was at a reasonable 0.25% of the worlds population. This was managable for the time and didn't cause too much stress.  
        </p>
            <p>
            In 2016 this population almost doubled from 2014 with a total population of 0.46%, at this rate we had to do something, bad things were coming our way.
            </p>
            <p>
            In 2019-2020 the vegan population went up to a whopping 1.5 percent tripling the previous 2016 calculation. We need to do something in the next few year or I believe this will be the end of the world.
